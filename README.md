# Catford E93

R scripts for processing and analysing data from the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve E93 experiment. 

## Description

There are three files:

1. e93_S0_function_library.R Contains all functions used in processing and analysis. Some have two versions because both were used at different points in the analysis. 

2. e93_S1_data_setup.R Script for processing species, trait and environmental data from E93 and related experiments. 

3. e93_S2_analysis.R Fitting models, model selection, estimating parameters from fitted models and plotting estimates.

## Authors

Annabel Smith and Jane Catford, except where indicated within the script.
